# Website for a fictional coffee shop business called: ☕"Roasters Cafe"🥐

This is my first project in which I use html, vanilla css and javascript to show what I've learned so far in front end development.

## Hero video as a key part of the project.

I wanted to replicate a nice visual effect that would catch the 👀 of the user and make them crave a cup of coffee!

## I took a mobile first approach to design:
